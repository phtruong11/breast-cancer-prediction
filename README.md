# Breast Cancer Prediction
A project for Boston University CS237 Probability in Computing.

In this project, we implemented a Logistic Regression model which analyzed data from Wisconsin Breast Cancer Data Set to predict if the patient has breast cancer. Our model was successfully able to determine the likelihood of the patient having cancer with an accuracy of 0.9416, a sensitivity of 0.8864, a specificity of 0.9474, and a precision of 0.9286.
